    /*
        Rust Community Guidelines for separation of concerns:alloc

            1. Split your program into both a main.rs and a lib.rs and move your programâ€™s logic into lib.rs.
            2. While your command line parsing logic is small, it can remain in main.rs.
            3. When the command line parsing logic starts getting complicated, extract it from main.rs into lib.rs as well.
            4. The responsibilities that remain in the main function after this process should be limited to:
                - Calling the command line parsing logic with the argument values
                - Setting up any other configuration
                - Calling a run function in lib.rs
                - If run returns an error, handling that error

        Check lesson27 for continuation...
