    // Rust is a statically typed language...
    // Which means it must know the type of the variables
    // at compile time.
    //
    // Note however that the compiler can usually infer the 
    // type we want to use, as seen above. However at points we 
    // might need to annotate the variable (for example when invoking string parse())
    //
    // Here are the common data types supported:
    
    //Scalar Types (Integers)

    //signed and unsigned works exactly the same as in C/C++
    //signed numbers are stored using "two complement" representation
    //each signed variant can store numbers from -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1) - 1
    //meaning for 8-bit for example it can store from -128 to 127
    //while signed can store from 0 to 2^n - 1 (meaning from 0 to 255)
    //
    //The isize and usize are platform dependant,
    //If it's a 64-bit architecture it will be 64-bits
    //on a 32-bit architecture it will be 32-bits and so on.
    //
    //Note:

    //than just ASCII. Accented letters, Chinese/Japanese/Korean ideographs, emoji and zero-width
    //spaces are all valid char types.
    
    // Compound Types
    // Can group multiple values together such as arrays and tuples

    //Also, Rust's array is allocated on the stack not on the heap.
    //Note, vector is similar to array however it's allowed to
    //grow and shrink... it's also part of the standard library.


    //println!("a[10] = {}", a[10]); // <-- index out of bounds exception at runtime.
    //Note that the in this scenario Rust will not allow access to the memory
    //it will instead crash with the Error (this is more inline to Java)
