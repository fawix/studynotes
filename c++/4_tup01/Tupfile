: hello.c |> gcc -Wall hello.c -o hello |> hello

# this is the simplest tup file we can write.
# Let's dissect this...
# it will be converted in: gcc hello.c -o hello

# The line above is known as a ':-rule' since it begins with a ':' 
# If you note it we have something in this structure:
# some_text |> some more text |> other_text
# the test between |>  simbols is the actual gcc command.
# The file listed on the left side of |> (hello.c) is the input
# The file listed on the right side of |> is the output (hello)
# (we'll get in details later)
#
# to trigger the build you must type either 'tup' or 'tup udp' in the command line
