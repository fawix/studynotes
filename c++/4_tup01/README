We will now explore tup.
It's an interesting build system although the license scheme is GPLv2

First things first, we need to get tup in our system... do the following:

git clone https://github.com/gittup/tup.git
cd tup
./bootstrap.sh
sudo cp tup.1 /usr/share/man/man1

Chances are that ./bootstrap.sh will ask you to install fuse if you don't already have it.
Last step is totally optional but allows you to do something like 'man tup' to see the documentation.

These under linux of course :) 

for other systems go to their website and check out the instructions:
http://gittup.org/tup/


Next you need to add tup to your path, for example:

export PATH=/path/to/tup/:$PATH


Subsequently the initial files in this folder are:

hello.c
Tupfile


In order to initialize tup we have to:

tup init <--- this command in the top of our source tree
	      this command will create a .tup directory 
	      which is used to to store dependencies and 
	      manage the build system

tup udp <--- this command will run the build using the Tupfile
