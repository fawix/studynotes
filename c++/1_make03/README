The original files for this folder are 

include/  Makefile  obj/  README  src/

./include:
hellomake.h

./obj:

./src:
hello.cpp  hellofunc.cpp

all other files can be safely removed.
Notice that in order to build the project all you have to do is:

make


This builds on the second example to create a more standardized make file
That is still simple enough to be easily maintained for medium to small projects in a development platform.
This is not good enough for cross development and potentially every new platform to be supported
would either require tweaking to the Makefile or a new makefile.

For larger projects check the more advanced 1_make04

Still make is very clean if you don't need a lot of cross compiling and for small projects.
