The original files for this folder are 

hellomake.cpp
hellofunc.cpp
hellomake.h
README
Makefile

all other files can be safely removed.
Notice that in order to build the project all you have to do is:

make


Note how this increases in complexity compared to our first example,
now imagine a enterprise level project with several files. Quite the nighmare to manage.

Still make is very clean if you don't need a lot of cross compiling and for small projects.

Note that for this particullar example we would normally have to 
figure out which file change and run a different gcc or g++ command every time...
If we didn't want to recompile the entire project.


One of the ways we can compile this project is as follows:

g++ hello.cpp hellofunc.cpp -o hello


Since this isn't a complex project we will only have a single binary out.
