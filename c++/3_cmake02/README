In this part we will be adding some custom params
from our build, let's say version :)


Starting files for this folder are 

sqroot.cpp (our simple c++ program)
CMakeLists.txt (our simple CMake File).
SqrootConfig.h.in (our simple header to read properties)

and This README. Can erase all the other files.

To build and run the program do the following



cmake .  	<--- this will generate make files
make 		<--- this will build the source code
./sqroot_n 	<--- this will run the program 


I also noticed that it doesn't clean the old crap. 
For example if you were to rename the executable file and 
build again you'll end up with 2 files on disk (one old and one new).
For building with same name files will be overwritten (not a bad thing).
