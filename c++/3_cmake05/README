In this example we will add some standard targets
like the 'install' target to allow the application to 
be installed in the /usr/bin folder

We will also add some tests to our application


Starting files for this folder are 

sqroot.cpp
CMakeLists.txt
SqrootConfig.h.in
libs/CMakeLists.txt
libs/mysqrt.cpp
libs/mysqrt.h
README 

Can erase all the other files.
To build and run the program do the following

cmake .  	<--- this will generate make files
ctest		<--- this will run the tests in our cmake file
make 		<--- this will build the source code
./sqroot_n 9 	<--- this will run the program
