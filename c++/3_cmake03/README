Now we will add an external library
So I'll make a custom implementation of sqroot
so we can see how that would look like in cmake

Starting files for this folder are 

sqroot.cpp
CMakeLists.txt
SqrootConfig.h.in
libs/CMakeLists.txt
libs/mysqrt.cpp
libs/mysqrt.h
README 

Can erase all the other files.
To build and run the program do the following

cmake .  	<--- this will generate make files
make 		<--- this will build the source code
./sqroot_n 9 	<--- this will run the program
