Fist build with CMAKE....

Starting files for this folder are 

sqroot.cpp (our simple c++ program)
CMakeLists.txt (our simple CMake File).

and This README. Can erase all the other files.

To build and run the program do the following



cmake .  	<--- this will generate make files
make 		<--- this will build the source code
/sqroot_n 9	<--- this will run the program 


I also noticed that it doesn't clean the old crap. 
For example if you were to rename the executable file and 
build again you'll end up with 2 files on disk (one old and one new).
For building with same name files will be overwritten (not a bad thing).
