In this example we see how to simplify the tupfile 



The initial files in this folder are:

hello.c
square.c
square.h
Tupfile


In order to initialize tup we have to:

tup init <--- this command in the top of our source tree
	      this command will create a .tup directory 
	      which is used to to store dependencies and 
	      manage the build system

tup upd <--- this command will run the build using the Tupfile
