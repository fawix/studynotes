Fist build with MAKE....

Starting files for this folder are 

sqroot.cpp (our simple c++ program)
Makefile (our simple Make File).
and This README. Can erase all the other files.


Normally we could build this code as such:

	gcc sqroot.cpp -lstdc++ -o sqroot_n1 -lm 
	g++ sqroot.cpp -o sqroot_n

However since we wrote the make file all you need to do is:

make 		<--- this will build the source code
/sqroot_n 9	<--- this will run the program 


Note that doing it this way keeps the project very clean,
however as the project grows managing the complexity of Makefile
can be rather challenging.
